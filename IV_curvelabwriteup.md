## Circuit Design

In this lab you will be required to have a basic understanding of how to construct a circuit on a breadboard and a fundamental understanding of Ohms law (Voltage = Current x Resistance). The circuit this lab will use is depicted below.
  
On the left side of the circuit is where the solar panel will be plugged into the breadboard. Depending on the output wire, which comes out the back of the panel, it will vary if an adapter is needed or the positive and negative ends can be directly plugged into the breadboard. If an adapter is required attach a female DC power adapter onto the end of the power cord coming out the back of the PV panel. Loosen the two screws on the top of the power adaptor. Next, insert the end of a wire into the adaptor and fasten into place by tightening the appropriate screw. Do this to both sides of the adaptor. Look closely at the top of the adaptor. There is a plus sign signifying the positive line and a minus sign signifying the negative line. Take note of which wire is connected to the positive and negative ports respectively as it will be important when constructing the circuit. Insert the wires into the breadboard and ensure they are not connected in series or parallel. Once the negative and positive ends are connected to the breadboard run a wire from the positive end to a location on the breadboard not connected to anything. After the wire is inserted into the breadboard attach a resistor in series with the end of the recently inserted wire. All measurements with the voltmeter will take place across this point of the circuit. On the end of the resistor not attached to the positive wire place another wire in series into the breadboard. Attach this wire to the negative end of the solar panel. Finally, from the negative side of the resistor insert another wire and place it in a location on the breadboard that is not being used. The purpose of this is to ground your circuit. The circuit is now complete and measurements can now be made. As mentioned previously all measurements will be made across the resistor. Start by inserting the 1 ohm resistor into the circuit. Attach the red end of the voltmeter to the positive side of the resistor and the black end to the negative side of the resistor. Measure the voltage and find the current using Ohm's law. Repeat these processes using different value resistors and create a table. Graph your data points using the x axis as the voltage and y axis as the current.
